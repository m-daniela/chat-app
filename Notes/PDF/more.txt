## Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)
- EC public-private key pair for both parties, to establish a shared secret
- key establishment:
	- domain parameters:
		- p  - prime number (or in case of binary, m and f(x))
		- a, b - const of the curve
		- G - generator/ base point
		- n - smalles number st nG = 0
		- h - cofactor
- each party has a private key d and a public key Q = d * G, then
	- A: (d_A, Q_A)
	- B: (d_B, Q_B)
- resulting in the shared secret x_k, from 
	- A: (x_k, y_k) = d_A * Q_B = d_A * d_b * G
	- B: (x_k, y_k) = d_B * Q_A = d_B * d_A * G


## Integrated enc scheme
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme)
- hybrid enc scheme prividing [semantic security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_security) (only negligible info about the plaintext can be feasibly extracted form the ciphertext) against an adversary allowed to used chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks
- sec based on the computaional Diffie Hellamn prob
- ECIES (Elliptic curve integrated enc scheme) is included

## Curve25519
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519)
- released in 2005
- elliptic curve
- 128 bits of security (256 bits kye size)
- used with elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange
- one of the fastest
- used curve is y^2 = x^3 + 486662x^2 + x ([Montgomery curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve)) over the field of Z_(2^255 - 19), base point x = 9

## NIST curves
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Fast_reduction_(NIST_curves))
 


## AES
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
- symmetric block cipher
- substitution-permutation network
- blocks of 128, 192, 256 bits


## AES GCM
- [GCM = Galois/ Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
- [CTR mode = counter mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_(CTR)) - turns a block cipher into a stream cipher

## SHA 
- [SHA - secure hash algos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)
- family of hash functions, published by NIST
- [something about these](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/)


## SHA 1
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)
- 160 bit hash value (message digest lol)


## SHA 2
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- 6 hash functions:
	- SHA 224 bits
	- SHA 256 bits
	- SHA 384 bits
	- SHA 512 bits
	- SHA 512/ 224 bits
	- SHA 512/ 256 bits


## OAEP - optimal asym enc padding
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding)
- padding scheme often used with RSA (RSA OEAP)
