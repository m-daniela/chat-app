**Extended Triple Diffie Hellamn**
- [x3dh](./PDF/Signal/x3dh.pdf)
- key agreement protocol, it establishes a shared secret key between two parties who mutually auth each other based on public keys 
- forward secrecy and crypto deniability
- async - offline communication

- 3 phases
	- Bob publshes his id key and prekeys to the server
	- Alice gets the prekey bundle from the server, used to send the first message to Bob
	- Bob recv the message from Alice

**Publishing keys**
- public keys - elliptic curve public keys (receiver - Bob)
	- id key - uploaded once
	- signed prekey - replaced after a time interval
	- prekey signature - replaced after a time interval
	- set of one-time prekeys - replaced at undefined times ?
- private key corresp to previous signed prekey can be kept, but should be deleted at some point in order to keep forward secrecy


**Initial message**
- the prekey bundle (of the recv) should contain:
	- id key
	- signed prekey
	- prekey signature
	- one-time prekey (opt)
- after the one-time prekey is sent, it should be deleted
- the signature verification occurs
- if the bundle doesn't contain the one-time prekey, the sender will compute an ephemeral key pair with their public key
- \<insert key computations\>
- after the SK is computed, the sender deletes the ephemeral private key and the DH outputs 
- computes associated data AD (maybe the metadata? since there might be certificates, usernames etc)
- the initial message (from the sender) contains:
	- id 
	- ephemeral key 
	- ids of the fetched prekeys used
	- An initial ciphertext encrypted with some AEAD encryption scheme [4] using AD as associated data and using an encryption key which is either secret key or the output from some cryptographic PRF keyed by secret key
- initial ciphertext has 2 roles:
	- first message in post x3dh protocol
	- sender's x3dh initial message
- later can be used the same secret key or keys derived from it within the post-x3dh protocol

**Recv the initial message**
- Bob retrieves Alice's id key and ephemeral key from the message
- using them and the private id key and the private keys corresp to the signed prekey and the one-time prekey, Bob, the recv, obtains the secret key and deletes the DH values
- bob constructs the associated data byte seq with the id key of the sender and his id key and decrypts using the secret key and deletes the one-time prekey private key (forward secrecy)
- if the decryption fails, the secret key is deleted
- like before, the secret key can be used later or derivations of it

**Security considerations**
- authentication
	- the parties may compare their id public keys 
	- if the auth is not performed, there is no guarantee that they are who they claim to be (mitm attacks possible LATER)

- protocol replay
	- if there is no one-time prekey from the sender, the message can be replayed to the recv and it might seem that the sender sent it more times ? and the same secret key might be derived
	- avoid 
		- in a post-x3dh protocol - new enc key for the sender from a new random input
		- blacklist of observed messages
		- replace old signed prekeys earlier
- replay and key reuse
	- any post-x3dh must randomize the encryption key before bob sends the data (ex: dh base ratcheting protocol etc.)
	- if not => key reuse, which is not good
- deniability
	- the protocol doesn't give the parties a publishable cryptographic proof of the contents of their comm or the fact that they communicated 
	- [OBS - deniable encryption describes encryption techniques where the existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that the plaintext data exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption)
	- MORE DETAILS HERE
- signatures
	- if there is no signature verification - the server could provide forged prekeys => key compromise
	- MORE DETAILS HERE
- key compromise
	- compromise of private keys => disastrous, cuould lead to impersonation or affect the security of secret key values
	- mitigation (a kind of) - use of ephemeral keys and prekeys
	- some compromise scenarios:	
		- 
		- 
		- 
- server trust
	- communication failure
	- if the communicating parties are authenticated, the server might refuse to hand out one-time prekeys and cause the forward secrecy of the secret key to depend on the signed prekey's lifetime
	- if one party attempts to drain the one-time prekeys of the other's, the server should prevent this (ex: rate limits on fetching the prekey bundles)
- identity binding
	- auth doesn't prevent identity misbinding/ unknown key share attacks
	- an attacker impersonates a party by presenting their prekey bundle as someone else's
	- making it harder for the attacker to lie about their identity: add more identifying info in the associated data, hash more identifying info etc. 
	- if they are still able to lie, that's bad

### Signal generalities
- [20. Cohn-Gordon2020_Article_AFormalSecurityAnalysisOfTheSi](./PDF/Papers/Signal/20.%20Cohn-Gordon2020_Article_AFormalSecurityAnalysisOfTheSi.pdf) which is [this one]()
- ratcheting, forward secrecy
- X3DH
- **EXTRA** - OTR was the first security protocol for instant messaging and after each message round trip?, the users established a new ephemeral Diffie-Hellman shared secret => ratcheting because you couldn't decrypt past messages
- **EXTRA** - widespread adoption of secure instant messaging protocols started with iMessage
- 3 stages:
	- initial key exchange with X3DH - long term, mid term and ephemeral DH keys to produce a shared secret root value
	- async ratchet - users alternate in sending the new ephemeral keys with prev generated root keys to generate forward secret chaining keys
	- sym ratchet - use key derivation functions to ratchet forward chaining keys to create sym enc keys
- => each message is encrypted with a new message key
- the ping pong pattern of new epehemaral keys inject auto entropy
- TextSecure - used Double ratche, called Axolotl ratchet at that time => RedPhone => Signal
- over 10 diff types of keys and a chain of updated keys

- async transmission protocol which requires pre-send batches of ephemeral public keys
- when a sender wants to send the messages, they get the keys and performs an AKE like protocol using the long term and ephemeral keys tp compute the message encryption key 
- the message keys depend on previous computations of the keys


- registration - users register their identity w/ a key distribution server and upload the long, mid term and eph keys
- session setup - get the public keys of the recv and establish initial enc keys (x3dh)
- sync messaging (asym ratchet updates) - sender exchanges their public keys with the recv and generate a shared secret => start chains of message keys, fresh ephemeral keys
- async messaging (sym ratchet) - a new sym message key is derived from the previous state, if no new message was sent by the recv, keys derived from the previous ephemeral dh public key of the sender


- uses X25519 or X448
- key derivation functions: HMAC SHA256, HKDF SHA256
- AEAD - encrypt then MAC scheme: AES256 in CBC, PKCS#5 padding, MAC is HMAC sha 256
- signature scheme based on ed25519
- the rest is highlighted in the other version of the paper



- [20. Signal Protocol - Makalah-Kripto-2020-06.pdf](./Pdf/papers/signal/20.%20Signal%20Protocol%20-%20Makalah-Kripto-2020-06.pdf)
- generate keys and send the bundle
- X25519, X448 ECDH
- xed-dsa signature scheme - x25519 or x448
- wrote before about the exchange



## MTProto

- https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/video-calls
- https://www.cybercitadel.com/signal-vs-telegram-a-detailed-comparison-of-security-and-privacy/
- https://telegram.org/evolution


- apps: Telegram
- section from the [docs](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end)
- the MTProto 2.0 uses 
	- SHA 256
	- padding
	- the message key depends on the message and a portion of the secret chat key
	- 12 - 1024 padding bytes used
- key generation using Diffie Hellman (the rest of the section is basically the theory of the exchange)
- initiator (sender) obtains the Diffie Hellman parameters (before each key generation, obviously): p prime, high order element g (a generator)
- p should be a 2048 bit prime and if the sender doesn't generate a good random number, the server gets this task etc. 
- sender executes request encryption and the receiver gets an update for all associated auth keys (devices), with data about the requestee
- after the receiver accepts the request, the chat is created and the receiver also gets the fresh config params for Diffie Hellman => random 2048 bit number b generated
- after the receiver gets g_a (the key sent from sender), if its length is smaller than 256 bytes, add 0 bytes as padding and the fingerprint has length 64 (for SHA1)
- the fingerprint is used to check for bugs
- key visualization uses the first 128 bits of the SHA1 original key (obtained at chat creation) + 160 bits from the SHA 256 key 
- about the same procedure for the sender (?) and if the fingerprint are the same, you can start chatting, otherwise, discard the encryption process (?)
- forward secrecy - clients reinitiate re-keying after 100 msg enc / decr or if it has been in usde for 1 week
- the old keys are discarded


- group messages are not encrypted, encryption is not by default

## Signcryption and iMessage

- apps: iMessage

**Apple iMessage**
- [official docs (this section)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209110) say that iMessage and FaceTime use end to end encryption, attachements are also encrypted (are uploaded and deleted after 30 days if the message was not sent)
- you can choose automatic deletion of the messages
- info stored:
	- use of services
	- messages that can't be delivered - held for 30 days
	- metadata about FaceTime calls, 30 days
	- contacts, 30 days
	
**Apple security and encryption**
- [Encryption and data protection, official (this section)](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/encryption-and-data-protection-overview-sece3bee0835/web)
- [Security overview](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/secd9764312f/web)
- APN - Apple Push Notification service 
- IDS - Apple Identity service
- encryption - RSA 1280 bit key, EC 256 bit key on NIST P 256 curve
- signatures - ECSDA
- private keys are saved in the device's keychain (API for passwords, keys and other sensitive credentials)
- public keys are sent to IDS

- [How iMessage sends and receives messages securely - also saved](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/sec70e68c949/web)
- methodology - Data Protection
- sender retrieves the public keys and APNs addresses for all associated devices of the receiver
- the message is individually encrypted for each device
- sender generates a random 88 bit value as a HMAC SHA 256 key to construct a value derived from the sender and recv public keys and the plaintext
- 88 + 40 = 128 bit key, which encrypts the message using AES in CTR mode
- 40 bit part used by the recv to verify the integrity of the decrypted message
- AES key is encrypted using RSA-OAEP public keys of the recv device, but iOS 13 or later might use ECIES encryption
- combination of the encr message and encr message key - hashed with SHA 1 and signed with ECSDA, using the private signing key
- recv gets: encryted message text, encrypted message key, sender's digital signature
- metadata (timestamp, APN routing info) is not encrypted
- if message too long, attachement is encrypted using AES in CTR mode with a randomly generated 256 bit key
- process repeated for each participant in a group

### Signcryption
- [Wiki](./PDF/Wiki/Signcryption.pdf)


- introduced in 1997, along with an elliptic curve signcryption (saves 58% computational and 40% communication costs, compared to the classical signature-then-encryption schemes)
- public key 
- functions of both digital signature and encryption, so you don't digitally sign the message and then encrypt it and in this way you decrease the cost and optimize the procedure 
- key generation, signcryption, unsigncryption
- properties:
  - correctness
  - efficiency
  - security, and some signcryption schemes provide public verifiability and foward secrecy, so: 
    - confidentiality
    - unforgeability
    - non-repudiation
    - integrity
    - public verifiability
    - forward secrecy and message confidentiality

- [Security under Message-Derived Keys Signcryption in iMessage](./PDF/Papers/iMessage/20.%20Security%20under%20Message-Derived%20Keys%20Signcryption%20in%20iMessage%20-%202020-224.pdf)

- iMessage uses signcryption to encrypt the messages
- iMessage uses a scheme that involves symmetric encryption with the key derived from the message, as it is stated in the article
- EMDK (encryption under message derived keys)
- protocol was revised after [CVE 2016 1788](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1788) was reported (addressed later) 
- signcryption aims to provide privacy of the message and authenticity

- https://help.line.me/line/?contentId=50001520



- https://d.line-scdn.net/stf/linecorp/en/csr/line-encryption-whitepaper-ver2.0.pdf
- apps: Line
- transport protocol: based on SPDY
- handshake protocol based on 0-RTT
- enc - elliptic curve crypto with secp256k1 curve for key exchange
- symmetric encryption - AES + HKDF for key derivation
- static keys - the private key is stored on the server??? and the public keys are embedded in the Line client apps
- key pair for key exchange - ECDH
- key pair for server identity verif - ECSDA
- clients are preinitialized with static ECDH keys => clients can include encrypted app data in the beginning


- handshake protocol, you need to exchange some data first:
- client: 
	- generate ephemeral ECDH key + 16 byte client [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce)
	- derive temp transport key and initialization vector (16bbytes long) using the server's static key and the ephemeral key generated before 
	- epehmeral ECDH client handshake generated
	- etc.
- server:
	- 
	- 
- client finish:
	- 

- data is encrypted with 128 bit key using AES GCM [AEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) cipher

	- transport layer lol 
- Elliptic curve based (255 bits)
- ECDH with curve25519
- hash function + random nonce = 256 symmetric key for each message
- to encrypt: [XSalsa20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20)

- doesn't require phone number/ email and it provides a [Threema ID](https://threema.ch/en/faq/threema_id) and contacts access is not mandatory
- personal info is hashed
- contacts or group chats are stored in a decentralized way on the users' devices, not on a server
- messages and media are e2ee
- data stored on servers:
	- messages and group chats until they are sent
	- email addresses and contacts are hashed until the comparizon is done (I guess it's the fact that the other one accepts your request/ you are in their contacts list?)
	- key pairs are locally generated 
	- no logs on who talks to whom
- for android - AES 256 based encryption for stored messages, media and the ID's private key

	- random nonce generated
	- XSalsa20 stream cipher with the shared secret and the random nonce to encrypt the plaintext
	- sender uses Poly1305 to compute a MAC and adds it to the ciphertext (prepend) a portion from XSalsa20 is used ot form the MAC key
	- sends MAC, cipertext and nonce to recv
	- decrypt and verify authenticity by reversing the steps

## Message authentication code
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code)
- short piece of info used to authenticate a message (confirm that it comes from the stated sender and has not been changed) - authentication and integrity

## Crypto nonce
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce)
- random/ pesuod-random number that can be used just once in a crypto communication, in an auth protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks 

## Replay attacks
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack)
- playback attacks
- sending valid data repeatedly or delayed maliciously or fraudulently


## Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)
- EC public-private key pair for both parties, to establish a shared secret
- key establishment:
	- domain parameters:
		- p  - prime number (or in case of binary, m and f(x))
		- a, b - const of the curve
		- G - generator/ base point
		- n - smalles number st nG = 0
		- h - cofactor
- each party has a private key d and a public key Q = d * G, then
	- A: (d_A, Q_A)
	- B: (d_B, Q_B)
- resulting in the shared secret x_k, from 
	- A: (x_k, y_k) = d_A * Q_B = d_A * d_b * G
	- B: (x_k, y_k) = d_B * Q_A = d_B * d_A * G


## Integrated enc scheme

## AES
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
- symmetric block cipher
- substitution-permutation network
- blocks of 128, 192, 256 bits


## AES GCM
- [GCM = Galois/ Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
- [CTR mode = counter mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_(CTR)) - turns a block cipher into a stream cipher

## SHA 
- [SHA - secure hash algos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)
- family of hash functions, published by NIST
- [something about these](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/)


## SHA 1
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)
- 160 bit hash value (message digest lol)


## SHA 2
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- 6 hash functions:
	- SHA 224 bits
	- SHA 256 bits
	- SHA 384 bits
	- SHA 512 bits
	- SHA 512/ 224 bits
	- SHA 512/ 256 bits


## OAEP - optimal asym enc padding
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding)
- padding scheme often used with RSA (RSA OEAP)

## Zero-knowledge proof
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)
- prove that you know a value x without showing it or give additional info

## Proof of work 
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work)
- (unrelated)
- a form of a zero knwoledge proof in which the prover proves to the verifiers that a certain lvl of computational effort was made for a purpose
- verifiers can confirm this with minimal effort on their side
- invented to deter ddos attacks and spam etc. 


## AKE
- authenticated key exchange
- require a trusted third party to certify users' identities


## Curve448
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve448)
- 224 bits
- designed for ECDH key agreement

## Deniable encryption
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption)
- adversary cannot prove that the plaintext from an enc msg exists
