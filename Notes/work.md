**Extended Triple Diffie Hellamn**
- [x3dh](./PDF/Signal/x3dh.pdf)
- key agreement protocol, it establishes a shared secret key between two parties who mutually auth each other based on public keys 
- forward secrecy and crypto deniability
- async - offline communication

- 3 phases
	- Bob publshes his id key and prekeys to the server
	- Alice gets the prekey bundle from the server, used to send the first message to Bob
	- Bob recv the message from Alice

**Publishing keys**
- public keys - elliptic curve public keys (receiver - Bob)
	- id key - uploaded once
	- signed prekey - replaced after a time interval
	- prekey signature - replaced after a time interval
	- set of one-time prekeys - replaced at undefined times ?
- private key corresp to previous signed prekey can be kept, but should be deleted at some point in order to keep forward secrecy


**Initial message**
- the prekey bundle (of the recv) should contain:
	- id key
	- signed prekey
	- prekey signature
	- one-time prekey (opt)
- after the one-time prekey is sent, it should be deleted
- the signature verification occurs
- if the bundle doesn't contain the one-time prekey, the sender will compute an ephemeral key pair with their public key
- \<insert key computations\>
- after the SK is computed, the sender deletes the ephemeral private key and the DH outputs 
- computes associated data AD (maybe the metadata? since there might be certificates, usernames etc)
- the initial message (from the sender) contains:
	- id 
	- ephemeral key 
	- ids of the fetched prekeys used
	- An initial ciphertext encrypted with some AEAD encryption scheme [4] using AD as associated data and using an encryption key which is either secret key or the output from some cryptographic PRF keyed by secret key
- initial ciphertext has 2 roles:
	- first message in post x3dh protocol
	- sender's x3dh initial message
- later can be used the same secret key or keys derived from it within the post-x3dh protocol

**Recv the initial message**
- Bob retrieves Alice's id key and ephemeral key from the message
- using them and the private id key and the private keys corresp to the signed prekey and the one-time prekey, Bob, the recv, obtains the secret key and deletes the DH values
- bob constructs the associated data byte seq with the id key of the sender and his id key and decrypts using the secret key and deletes the one-time prekey private key (forward secrecy)
- if the decryption fails, the secret key is deleted
- like before, the secret key can be used later or derivations of it

**Security considerations**
- authentication
	- the parties may compare their id public keys 
	- if the auth is not performed, there is no guarantee that they are who they claim to be (mitm attacks possible LATER)

- protocol replay
	- if there is no one-time prekey from the sender, the message can be replayed to the recv and it might seem that the sender sent it more times ? and the same secret key might be derived
	- avoid 
		- in a post-x3dh protocol - new enc key for the sender from a new random input
		- blacklist of observed messages
		- replace old signed prekeys earlier
- replay and key reuse
	- any post-x3dh must randomize the encryption key before bob sends the data (ex: dh base ratcheting protocol etc.)
	- if not => key reuse, which is not good
- deniability
	- the protocol doesn't give the parties a publishable cryptographic proof of the contents of their comm or the fact that they communicated 
	- [OBS - deniable encryption describes encryption techniques where the existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that the plaintext data exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption)
	- MORE DETAILS HERE
- signatures
	- if there is no signature verification - the server could provide forged prekeys => key compromise
	- MORE DETAILS HERE
- key compromise
	- compromise of private keys => disastrous, cuould lead to impersonation or affect the security of secret key values
	- mitigation (a kind of) - use of ephemeral keys and prekeys
	- some compromise scenarios:	
		- 
		- 
		- 
- server trust
	- communication failure
	- if the communicating parties are authenticated, the server might refuse to hand out one-time prekeys and cause the forward secrecy of the secret key to depend on the signed prekey's lifetime
	- if one party attempts to drain the one-time prekeys of the other's, the server should prevent this (ex: rate limits on fetching the prekey bundles)
- identity binding
	- auth doesn't prevent identity misbinding/ unknown key share attacks
	- an attacker impersonates a party by presenting their prekey bundle as someone else's
	- making it harder for the attacker to lie about their identity: add more identifying info in the associated data, hash more identifying info etc. 
	- if they are still able to lie, that's bad


## MTProto

- https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/video-calls
- https://www.cybercitadel.com/signal-vs-telegram-a-detailed-comparison-of-security-and-privacy/
- https://telegram.org/evolution


- apps: Telegram
- section from the [docs](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end)
- the MTProto 2.0 uses 
	- SHA 256
	- padding
	- the message key depends on the message and a portion of the secret chat key
	- 12 - 1024 padding bytes used
- key generation using Diffie Hellman (the rest of the section is basically the theory of the exchange)
- initiator (sender) obtains the Diffie Hellman parameters (before each key generation, obviously): p prime, high order element g (a generator)
- p should be a 2048 bit prime and if the sender doesn't generate a good random number, the server gets this task etc. 
- sender executes request encryption and the receiver gets an update for all associated auth keys (devices), with data about the requestee
- after the receiver accepts the request, the chat is created and the receiver also gets the fresh config params for Diffie Hellman => random 2048 bit number b generated
- after the receiver gets g_a (the key sent from sender), if its length is smaller than 256 bytes, add 0 bytes as padding and the fingerprint has length 64 (for SHA1)
- the fingerprint is used to check for bugs
- key visualization uses the first 128 bits of the SHA1 original key (obtained at chat creation) + 160 bits from the SHA 256 key 
- about the same procedure for the sender (?) and if the fingerprint are the same, you can start chatting, otherwise, discard the encryption process (?)
- forward secrecy - clients reinitiate re-keying after 100 msg enc / decr or if it has been in usde for 1 week
- the old keys are discarded

- e2ee is available only for secret chats and calls (2 people, groups are not included)
- no default encryption
- messages are not stored after delivery


## Signcryption and iMessage
- [Official](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209110)
- [E2ee official](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/encryption-and-data-protection-overview-sece3bee0835/1/web/1)

- [Chosen Ciphertext Attacks on Apple iMessage](./PDF/Papers/iMessage/17.%20Chosen%20Ciphertext%20Attacks%20on%20Apple%20iMessage%20-%20imessage.pdf)


- apps: iMessage

**Apple iMessage**
- [official docs (this section)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209110) say that iMessage and FaceTime use end to end encryption, attachements are also encrypted (are uploaded and deleted after 30 days if the message was not sent)
- you can choose automatic deletion of the messages
- info stored:
	- use of services
	- messages that can't be delivered - held for 30 days
	- metadata about FaceTime calls, 30 days
	- contacts, 30 days
	
**Apple security and encryption**
- [Encryption and data protection, official (this section)](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/encryption-and-data-protection-overview-sece3bee0835/web)
- [Security overview](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/secd9764312f/web)
- APN - Apple Push Notification service 
- IDS - Apple Identity service
- encryption - RSA 1280 bit key, EC 256 bit key on NIST P 256 curve
- signatures - ECSDA
- private keys are saved in the device's keychain (API for passwords, keys and other sensitive credentials)
- public keys are sent to IDS

- [How iMessage sends and receives messages securely - also saved](https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/sec70e68c949/web)
- methodology - Data Protection
- sender retrieves the public keys and APNs addresses for all associated devices of the receiver
- the message is individually encrypted for each device
- sender generates a random 88 bit value as a HMAC SHA 256 key to construct a value derived from the sender and recv public keys and the plaintext
- 88 + 40 = 128 bit key, which encrypts the message using AES in CTR mode
- 40 bit part used by the recv to verify the integrity of the decrypted message
- AES key is encrypted using RSA-OAEP public keys of the recv device, but iOS 13 or later might use ECIES encryption
- combination of the encr message and encr message key - hashed with SHA 1 and signed with ECSDA, using the private signing key
- recv gets: encryted message text, encrypted message key, sender's digital signature
- metadata (timestamp, APN routing info) is not encrypted
- if message too long, attachement is encrypted using AES in CTR mode with a randomly generated 256 bit key
- process repeated for each participant in a group

### Signcryption
- [Wiki](./PDF/Wiki/Signcryption.pdf)


- introduced in 1997, along with an elliptic curve signcryption (saves 58% computational and 40% communication costs, compared to the classical signature-then-encryption schemes)
- public key 
- functions of both digital signature and encryption, so you don't digitally sign the message and then encrypt it and in this way you decrease the cost and optimize the procedure 
- key generation, signcryption, unsigncryption
- properties:
  - correctness
  - efficiency
  - security, and some signcryption schemes provide public verifiability and foward secrecy, so: 
    - confidentiality
    - unforgeability
    - non-repudiation
    - integrity
    - public verifiability
    - forward secrecy and message confidentiality

- [Security under Message-Derived Keys Signcryption in iMessage](./PDF/Papers/iMessage/20.%20Security%20under%20Message-Derived%20Keys%20Signcryption%20in%20iMessage%20-%202020-224.pdf)

- iMessage uses signcryption to encrypt the messages
- iMessage uses a scheme that involves symmetric encryption with the key derived from the message, as it is stated in the article
- EMDK (encryption under message derived keys)
- protocol was revised after [CVE 2016 1788](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1788) was reported (addressed later) 
- signcryption aims to provide privacy of the message and authenticity

- https://help.line.me/line/?contentId=50001520



- https://d.line-scdn.net/stf/linecorp/en/csr/line-encryption-whitepaper-ver2.0.pdf
- apps: Line
- transport protocol: based on SPDY
- handshake protocol based on 0-RTT
- enc - elliptic curve crypto with secp256k1 curve for key exchange
- symmetric encryption - AES + HKDF for key derivation
- static keys - the private key is stored on the server??? and the public keys are embedded in the Line client apps
- key pair for key exchange - ECDH
- key pair for server identity verif - ECSDA
- clients are preinitialized with static ECDH keys => clients can include encrypted app data in the beginning


- handshake protocol, you need to exchange some data first:
- client: 
	- generate ephemeral ECDH key + 16 byte client [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce)
	- derive temp transport key and initialization vector (16bbytes long) using the server's static key and the ephemeral key generated before 
	- epehmeral ECDH client handshake generated
	- etc.
- server:
	- 
	- 
- client finish:
	- 

- data is encrypted with 128 bit key using AES GCM [AEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) cipher

		- a, b - const of the curve
		- G - generator/ base point
		- n - smalles number st nG = 0
		- h - cofactor
- each party has a private key d and a public key Q = d * G, then
	- A: (d_A, Q_A)
	- B: (d_B, Q_B)
- resulting in the shared secret x_k, from 
	- A: (x_k, y_k) = d_A * Q_B = d_A * d_b * G
