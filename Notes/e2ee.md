# End-to-end encryption

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. Even though the service provider stores the messages, they cannot read or modify the data, since they cannot decrypt it. The recipients retrieve the data and decrypt it themselves.

## How it works

End-to-end encryption involves public key cryptography


## Challenges

End-to-end encryption 

**Man in the middle attacks**

**Endpoint security**

**Backdoors**


# Signal protocol
- Triple Diffie Hellman key exchange
- Prekey bundle
- Double ratchet algo
