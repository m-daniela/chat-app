# Paper review

## CURRENT

- [20. Vatandas2020_Chapter_OnTheCryptographicDeniabilityO.pdf](./pdf/papers/signal/20.%20Vatandas2020_Chapter_OnTheCryptographicDeniabilityO.pdf) - deniability and some analysis on this


## Reviewed
- [20. Signal Protocol - Makalah-Kripto-2020-06.pdf](./Pdf/papers/signal/20.%20Signal%20Protocol%20-%20Makalah-Kripto-2020-06.pdf) - 2pg, good for a quick refresher of what tech is signal using
- [21. r - The Secure Messaging App Conundrum Signal vs. Telegram - 80890725610443713565418232349082attachment.pdf](./pdf/papers/signal/21.%20r%20-%20The%20Secure%20Messaging%20App%20Conundrum%20Signal%20vs.%20Telegram%20-%2080890725610443713565418232349082attachment.pdf) - 4pg, a little comparisong between the 2 apps and sometimes wapp (**states that telegram has no enc for groups**)

## Partially
- [Signal analysis](PDF/Papers/Signal/16.%2019.%20r%20-%20A%20Formal%20Security%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Signal%20Messaging%20Protocol%20-%202016-1013.pdf) - 46pg, strong analysis with schemes and theorems
- [20. Cohn-Gordon2020_Article_AFormalSecurityAnalysisOfTheSi](./PDF/Papers/Signal/20.%20Cohn-Gordon2020_Article_AFormalSecurityAnalysisOfTheSi.pdf) - same as the one called "signal analysis", it might have some more details since it was reviewed in 2020

- attachement enc
- group enc
- demo + no encryption

# Working features
- login
- signup
- logout
- see conversations
- add conversation
- see messages
- send msg (real time)
- encryption + decryption


# To fix/ do
- groups
	- add group and add chat should look normal together
- error handling
- duplicating messages again???
- state updates twitching/ loading 
- same id for messages
- check private keys
- add session
- cache accessed chats
- optimize data clearing, data loading
- maybe add deletion on messages/ chats


# Fixed
- signup fix (login model)
- reset everything on logout - conversation remains selected
- chat name selection - working only on second click - need to change the state
- fix the real time thing
- refresh mesages
- order by timestamp

example5@mail.com


## In firebase
- users (name of the user)
	- conversations (name of the chat)
		- messages
		+ participants (better as an array, probably, with everyone)

sendMessage(sender, name, receivers, text, date)

Main thing
- what schemes are used by each protocol
- signal
	- x3dh handshake
	- curve 25519
	- aes 256
	- HMAC sha 256
- mtproto
	- sha 256
	- 
- signcryption
	- ecsda
	- rsa 1280 key, ec 256 bit key

	- xsalsa 20
	- sha 256
	- poly 1305
- common parts
- what is added by each protocol 

1. Introduction

2. Basic concepts
- some diagrams can be added, from the book or wiki
- Symmetric
	- more details?
- AES / ++ from the book
	- details
	- implementation
	- vulnerabilities
- PK
	- maybe something about TLS and RSA?
	- Attacks/
		- Impersonation/
		- Chosen plaintext/

	- MLS 
		- MORE DETAILS OMG I SHOULD READ THE DRAFTS AND CHECK THE IMPLEMENTATIONS 

4. Tech used
- React + redux toolkit

- Socket.io
- Firebase
- Virgil Security
- Docker

5. Application
- specs and features idk

- login/ signup
- logout
- display chats
- select chat and send messages
- add chat
- delete chats? 
- delete messages?

6. Conclusions

7. References <3

Different from last time:
- "basic concepts" section, updates on:
	- symmetric key
	- public key
	- auth
	- AES
	- Diffie Hellman
	- Elliptic curves
- "existing tech" section
	- group messaging 
- "application" section
	- features and layout

- send the message id back somehow
- send something back when you delete so that thing can be handled
- learn to speak lol
- change the default confirm window, maybe use a component

- do the same things for the conversations /
- change to another chat or initial page after you delete a chat/
- implement the broadcast method that tells everyone you left/ - implemented but only writes to the console
- delete the messages for the user that removes


- the message loading was changed to the previous version of calling everything again from the db, on new message
- I will keep this for now because fuck everything
- maybe I'll add a limit and infinite scroll
- and I will definetly need to fix the twitching issue

BROADCAST WILL ONLY WORK FOR THE GROUPS

FIREBASE DOESN'T DELETE THE DOCUMENTS IN THE COLLECTION


- new
- delete conversations 
- broadcast "user left" message - console
- add group functionality is back


- https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/e3kit/end-to-end-encryption/large-files-and-streams/
- for the attachment fun
- encryptSharedFile - new key pair to enc the file 
- the encrypted file needs to be uploaded to remote storage and the link and the enc stream key need to be sent to the recipient

- decryptSharedFile - for decryption
